12/8/22 - I am now beginning the sign up form project as a part of the Intermediate HTML and CSS section of The Odin Project's Javascript track. I will create a simple sign up page, featuring client side form validation.

12/15/22 - I have finished the sign up page. I added a few extra bits, including Javascript validation for confirming that the passwords match and a decently styled version for mobile screens.
